# Agent skill: `agent-web-context` (Codex compatible)

This repo ships a general-purpose agent skill at `skills/agent-web-context/` (works well with Codex).

Install/use instructions live in `README.md` under “Using from agent skills”.

Note: the skill persists the service `base_url` in `<install_dir>/agent-web-context/references/service.json` (created on first use).
