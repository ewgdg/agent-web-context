description: Call a running agent-web-context HTTP API (FastAPI/OpenAPI) by reading a persisted base_url, then discover available operations from the service OpenAPI schema.

# agent-web-context

## Workflow

1. Read `references/service.json` (if present) and get `base_url`.
2. If `base_url` is missing/empty, or the user says it changed:
   - Ask the user for the service base URL (example: `http://localhost:8000`).
   - Update it by running `scripts/set_base_url.py` with the new URL (do not hand-edit JSON).
     - Example: `python3 scripts/set_base_url.py http://localhost:8000`
   - Re-read `references/service.json` and continue only after confirming `base_url` is non-empty.
3. Dynamic discovery mode:
   - Ensure `references/openapi_cache/index.json` exists; if it doesn’t, run `scripts/refresh_openapi_cache.py` to generate it (and per-operation files).
   - Update the cache by re-running `scripts/refresh_openapi_cache.py`:
     - when `base_url` changes
     - when the service version changes or requests start failing due to drift
     - periodically if you’re unsure (it uses HTTP `ETag`/`If-None-Match` when available, so it’s cheap when unchanged)
   - Read `references/openapi_cache/index.json` to discover available operations, then open only the specific operation file(s) you need from `references/openapi_cache/operations/`.
4. Do not hardcode endpoint lists; treat the split OpenAPI cache as the source of truth.

## Notes

- `references/service.json` is user-specific and is not shipped in the repo; it should be created/updated via `scripts/set_base_url.py`.
- `references/openapi_cache/` is generated by `scripts/refresh_openapi_cache.py` and should be treated as disposable.
